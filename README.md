# Sudoku Solver

## What is is?

A C++-based AI sudoku solver. It implements [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) and [constraint satisfaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction) to solve a sudoku (or determine whether the sudoku is actually solvable).

## How to run

I recommend using Visual Studio. The `Main.cpp` file includes example usage.

## Future plans

Create an interface to load in a sudoku, allow the user to attempt to solve it, and then provide a 'solve'/'check' button.
